RailsAdmin.config do |config|


  ################  Global configuration  ################

  # Set the admin name here (optional second array element will appear in red). For example:
  config.main_app_name = ['Noteblock', 'Admin']
  # or for a more dynamic name:
  # config.main_app_name = Proc.new { |controller| [Rails.application.engine_name.titleize, controller.params['action'].titleize] }

  # RailsAdmin may need a way to know who the current user is]
  config.current_user_method { current_admin } # auto-generated

  # If you want to track changes on your models:
  # config.audit_with :history, 'Admin'

  # Or with a PaperTrail: (you need to install it first)
  # config.audit_with :paper_trail, 'Admin'

  # Display empty fields in show views:
  # config.compact_show_view = false

  # Number of default rows per-page:
  # config.default_items_per_page = 20

  # Exclude specific models (keep the others):
  # config.excluded_models = ['Note', 'NoteTransaction']

  # Include specific models (exclude the others):
  # config.included_models = ['Note', 'NoteTransaction']

  # Label methods for model instances:
  # config.label_methods << :description # Default is [:name, :title]


  ################  Model configuration  ################

  # Each model configuration can alternatively:
  #   - stay here in a `config.model 'ModelName' do ... end` block
  #   - go in the model definition file in a `rails_admin do ... end` block

  # This is your choice to make:
  #   - This initializer is loaded once at startup (modifications will show up when restarting the application) but all RailsAdmin configuration would stay in one place.
  #   - Models are reloaded at each request in development mode (when modified), which may smooth your RailsAdmin development workflow.


  # Now you probably need to tour the wiki a bit: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki
  # Anyway, here is how RailsAdmin saw your application's models when you ran the initializer:



  ###  Note  ###

  config.model 'Note' do

    # You can copy this to a 'rails_admin do ... end' block inside your note.rb model definition

    # Found associations:

      configure :note_transactions, :has_many_association

    # Found columns:

      configure :id, :integer
      configure :content, :string
      configure :sender, :string
      configure :email, :string
      configure :address, :string
      configure :encrypted_token, :string
      configure :encrypted_private_key, :string
      configure :flagged, :boolean
      configure :created_at, :datetime
      configure :updated_at, :datetime

    # Cross-section configuration:

      # object_label_method :name     # Name of the method called for pretty printing an *instance* of ModelName
      # label 'My model'              # Name of ModelName (smartly defaults to ActiveRecord's I18n API)
      # label_plural 'My models'      # Same, plural
      # weight 0                      # Navigation priority. Bigger is higher.
      # parent OtherModel             # Set parent model for navigation. MyModel will be nested below. OtherModel will be on first position of the dropdown
      # navigation_label              # Sets dropdown entry's name in navigation. Only for parents!

    # Section specific configuration:

      list do
        field :content
        field :flagged
        field :sender
        field :email
        field :address

        filters []  # Array of field names which filters should be shown by default in the table header
        items_per_page 100    # Override default_items_per_page
        # sort_by :id           # Sort column (default is primary key)
        # sort_reverse true     # Sort direction (default is true for primary key, last created first)
      end
      show do; end
      edit do; end
      export do; end
      # also see the create, update, modal and nested sections, which override edit in specific cases (resp. when creating, updating, modifying from another model in a popup modal or modifying from another model nested form)
      # you can override a cross-section field configuration in any section with the same syntax `configure :field_name do ... end`
      # using `field` instead of `configure` will exclude all other fields and force the ordering
  end

  # config.model 'NoteTransaction' do
